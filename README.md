# DataCleaningProject
Demonstrating the process of cleaning and preparing raw data using SQL queries

## Overview
In the Nashville Housing Data Cleaning Project, I focused on preprocessing the Nashville housing dataset to enhance its quality and usability. Using SQL queries and data manipulation techniques, my objective was to optimize the dataset for further analysis.

## Objectives
    • Populate Property Address Data: 
      I utilized SQL queries to fill in missing or incomplete property address information, ensuring a comprehensive dataset.
    • Break Down Addresses into Individual Columns: 
      I extracted relevant information such as address, city, and state into separate columns for improved data organization and searchability.
    • Standardize Yes/No Responses: 
      I converted the "Y" and "N" values to "Yes" and "No" for better readability and consistency.
    • Remove Duplicates: 
      I identified and eliminated duplicate entries from the dataset, promoting data accuracy and preventing potential biases.
    • Delete Unused Columns: 
      I removed irrelevant or redundant columns to streamline the dataset and focus on essential features.

## Data Source
The original Nashville housing dataset was obtained from [AlexTheAnalyst] (https://github.com/AlexTheAnalyst), and it contains information on Nashville Housing.
